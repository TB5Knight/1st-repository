        <p>This is my digital art page, showcasing creations from the past year that reflect my identity. 
            The designs symbolize various aspects of my life, including my school and favorite sport. 
            Some pieces were made for special occasions like birthdays and holidays, while others focus on 
            different professional sports teams in Florida. The first row describes a little bit about me.
            The second row of my  three designs were for my family. The last row were designs I created for fun.
